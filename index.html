            <p><strong>Make sure to do these steps in actual phone browser like Safari - not snap browser</strong></p>
            <p>1. Download <a href="https://altstore.io/" target="_blank">AltStore</a> on your computer, scroll down and download the either the Windows or Mac version.</p>
            <p>If you're a Windows user, <a href="https://youtu.be/IXymBZTl8lQ?si=xfhG4sB2YG_U4lWl" target="_blank">watch this</a> for the computer part.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>2.<a href="https://programleg.github.io/apps/newer/mySAGOV.ipa" target="_blank">Download this IPA file on your phone.</a></p>
            <p>If it comes up with Untrusted Developer warning, go to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management then trust the developer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>3. Open AltStore on your phone and go to the My Apps tab.</p>
            <p>Click on the plus button and find your mySAGOV.ipa file, then tap it. It should start installing.</p>
            <p><strong>Make sure your iPhone is still connected to your Mac and AltServer is running.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>4. Open the new app. Send me your code and I'll unlock it remotely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>5. <a href="https://adlservices.github.io/config.html" target="_blank">Fill out this form on your phone.</a> Everything can be made up (if you want), just make sure to follow the right format.</p>
            <p>Press 'Click to confirm details' to download your config file.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>6. Now go to your 'Downloads' folder in Files app and copy the file you just downloaded. Make sure it is named exactly 'config.json'. Then paste it into the 'mySAGOV' folder.  This folder is in On My Iphone folder.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>7. Find a photo for your ID photo. It's best if it's your actual Driver's License photo or a portrait of you with a white background.</p>
            <p></p>In the camera roll, share the photo and 'Save to Files'. Save it to the 'mySAGOV' folder then rename it as 'portrait.jpg'.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>8. Relaunch the app and everything should be good! Swipe up the MySAGOV app then reopen it.</p>

            <h4>Also, because of Apple's regulations, the app has to be refreshed every 7 days. You can simply do this by reconnecting your phone to your computer and reinstalling Altstore through Altserver on your computer.</h4>
